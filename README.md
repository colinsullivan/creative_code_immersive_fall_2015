This repository contains Colin's sample code for sharing with students during the Gray Area creative code immersive during fall 2015.

Explanation of individual directories is below:

* `rockpaperscissors/`: During the JavaScript week, we build a rock paper scissors game.  This implementation focuses on extensibility of the game logic.  Check out [scripts/scripts.js](https://github.com/colinsullivan/creative_code_immersive_fall_2015/blob/master/rockpaperscissors/scripts/scripts.js) for the most important bits.
* `flickrfeed/`: This is an adaptation of our FlickrFeed example, which is a webpage that loads in photos from a public Flickr feed.  This example demonstrates how to use the jQuery library to create HTML elements and add them to the page dynamically upon receiving data from the Flickr feed.  Again, the most relevant code can be found in [scripts/scripts.js](https://github.com/colinsullivan/creative_code_immersive_fall_2015/blob/master/flickrfeed/scripts/scripts.js).
* `HSV_Pot_Fader/`: An Arduino sketch demonstrating how to modify an LED using the HSV color space.  See `HSV_Pot_Fader/README.md` for more info!
