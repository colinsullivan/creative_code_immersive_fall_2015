I often find the HSB color space easier to understand than RGB, especially when transitioning between colors.  Using the "FastLED" library, we can utilize the HSV color space and easily convert to RGB to send to our light.  Here is the "RGB_Pot_Fader" example modified to change the "hue" of the light across the spectrum.  You'll need to install the "FastLED" library using the "Library Manager" (Sketch -> Include Library -> Manage Libraries).
